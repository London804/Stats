All icons should be in a sprite image.

Use sass to create the styles.css as your external style sheet.

Use javascript and the provided JSON (stats.json) to display all the dynamic content (text) within each 
section of the module and to add functionality to the tabs "Summary" and "Member page traffic"

You may use dojo or jquery framework if desired.

Bonus - convert the module to render responsively on mobile/tablet and incorporate any animations as you see fit.
